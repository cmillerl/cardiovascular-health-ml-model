# Supervised Logistic Regression Machine Learning Model

A predictive machine learning model that predicts cardiovascular disease risk in fictional patients.

```This cardiovascular disease prediction tool is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is NOT intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. This tool should only be used with fictional patient data for learning purposes.```

```DO NOT use this tool for actual medical decisions. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiovascular conditions. The predictions generated by this tool are not a substitute for professional medical judgment and should never be used to make healthcare decisions.```

```By using this tool, you acknowledge that it is for educational purposes only and not for real medical use.```

## Project Features

**Machine Learning Model** - Supervised logistic regression model trained on a Kaggle cardiovascular disease dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)

**Front-End (UI)** - A user friendly form for inputting and submitting fictional patient data

**Back-End (API)** - Flask based REST API with two endpoints:

    GET: / 
    (displays a welcome message to the user)
    
    POST /predict 
    (submit patient data and receive a prediction from the cardiovascular disease prediction machine learning model)

## Model Performance

**Precision**: 73% (weighted avg.)

**Recall**: 73% (weighted avg.)

**F1 Score**: 73% (weighted avg.)

**Accuracy**: 73.1%

## Requirements To Run Locally

    - Python 3.13+
    - pandas
    - scikit-learn 
    - flask
    - flask-cors
    - joblib

    - py -m pip install pandas
    - py -m pip install -U scikit-learn
    - py -m pip install flask
    - py -m pip install flask-cors
    - py -m pip install joblib

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository to your IDE**

        git clone https://github.com/cmillerl/cardiovascular-health-ml-model

2. **Install the latest version of Python with pip**

        https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. **Install the required Python packages**

        py -m pip install pandas flask flask-cors joblib scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

4. **Ensure the four data files exist if you want to run the full-stack application locally**

        data/cardiovascular_model.pkl
    
        data/cardiovascular-data.csv
    
        data/scaler.pkl
    
        data/statistics.json

5. **If the data files don't exist**

        py main.py

6. **If the data files exist**

        Launch the back-end: py app.py
    
        Launch the front-end with an extension such as Live Server

        Front-end: http://localhost:8080/index.html
    
        Back-end API: http://localhost:5000/

7. **To get a prediction**

        All form fields must contain an integer. (Strings, floating points, and blank fields will cause an error.)

        All radio buttons must have one option selected.

        The medical disclaimer checkbox must be checked before making a prediction.

        Click "Make A Prediction" to receive a binary outcome. Low or High Risk of CVD.
