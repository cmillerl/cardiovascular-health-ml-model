# Supervised Logistic Regression Machine Learning Model

A predictive machine learning model that predicts cardiovascular disease risk in fictional patients.

```This cardiovascular disease prediction tool is for educational and demonstration purposes only. It is NOT intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations. This tool should only be used with fictional patient data for learning purposes.```

```DO NOT use this tool for actual medical decisions. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiovascular conditions. The predictions generated by this tool are not a substitute for professional medical judgment and should never be used to make healthcare decisions.```

```By using this tool, you acknowledge that it is for educational purposes only and not for real medical use.```

## Project Features

**Machine Learning Model** - Supervised logistic regression model trained on a Kaggle cardiovascular disease dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)

**Front-End (UI)** - A user friendly form for inputting and submitting fictional patient data

**Back-End (API)** - Flask based REST API with two endpoints:

    GET: / 
    (displays a welcome message to the user)
    
    POST /predict 
    (submit patient data and receive a prediction from the cardiovascular disease prediction machine learning model)
